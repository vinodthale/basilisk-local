# Impact forces of air-in-liquid compound  drop.
Code to simulate the impact of an air-in-liquid compound drop  using the Basilisk flow solver. (DNS)

Installation
The code relies on a basilisk flow solver to simulate the impact forces of air-in-liquid compound  drop onto to substrate. More information about the basilisk solver can be found at. http://basilisk.dalembert.upmc.fr/ 

Running the code
Use the script ClusterMPI.sh
